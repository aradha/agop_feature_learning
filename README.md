# Code for feature learning with Average Gradient Outer Product (AGOP) 

In `ansatz_verification`, we present code for verifying that AGOP is highly correlated with Neural Feature Matrices (NFMs) for transformers, CNNs, RNNs, and MLPs.  In each directory, we provide a README outlining the requirements needed to run corresponding code.  

In `feature_visualizations`, we provide code for visualizing features captured by AGOP of CNNs (an example is provided for VGG-19) and GPT2-architecture language models (an example is provided for a model trained on the TinyStories dataset).  

In `kernel_machine_agop`, we provide code for computing AGOP of trained kernel machines using Laplace kernel and Convolutional Neural Tangent Kernel (CNTK).
