Code for training Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs) on tabular data.  The code provided in this directory iteratively solves kernel regression with Laplace kernel, computes AGOP of the trained kernel machine, and then re-introduces AGOP features to improve performance. We have attempted to make the API for using RFMs as simple as possible by following the `model.fit` paradigm from scikit-learn. A tutorial for training RFMs on a low rank polynomial and extracting features is provided in `RFM_Tutorial.ipynb`.  Code for utilizing RFM on CelebA data is presented in `RFM_CelebA.ipynb`.
