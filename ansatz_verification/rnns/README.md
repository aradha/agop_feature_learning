This directory contains the code to verify the NFA on RNNs (a basic RNN and a GRU) on two datasets - 
name generation and shakespeare text generation. We modified the implementations from two tutorials 
Names (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_generation_tutorial.html) and Shakespeare (https://github.com/spro/char-rnn.pytorch).
